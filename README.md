# MyReads Project

This is a react based bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read

## App Functionality

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

Currently Reading
Want to Read
Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.

The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.
